# Instructions for Claude Code

This is a **VibeCoding NestJS template** — a minimal NestJS starter with strict guardrails.

## Rules

Read `AGENT.md` for complete development guidelines.

**Key guardrails enforced:**
- Zero `: any` (TypeScript strict mode)
- Max 500 lines per file
- Max complexity 15 (SonarJS)
- 80% test coverage minimum
- Conventional commits enforced

All violations are automatically blocked by pre-commit/pre-push hooks.
